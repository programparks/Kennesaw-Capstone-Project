Summary: I bring my background as a life-long performer and creative writer into the science communication realm. &#92;n&#92;nThrough Science Art Fusion, my science communication consulting and training company, I offer professional development workshops, one-on-one consulting, training and talks specifically crafted to help science professionals polish their outreach efforts. I take out all the fluff and focus on the best practices most likely to turn you into a science communication rockstar so you can get more expertise in less time.&#92;n&#92;nI also practice what I preach by creating my own creative science communication outreach. I host the nationally touring Solve for X Science Variety Show, which takes professional performers and has them do hilarious acts inspired by science. And stay tuned for my upcoming project: a computer game that communicates the nuanced issue of sea level rise and land loss in coastal Louisiana, created for the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium. &#92;n&#92;nThe four things I value most in communication: Narrative, novelty, interactivity and empathy

Projects:
    Corporate Sleepover    Time: 2013.7 ~ 2014.4    Description: Worked on developing the programming for a sleepover designed for companies to bring their employees for bonding and trust building. 
    Deepo&#39;s Chat Room Digital Puppet Show    Time: 2012 ~ 2013    Description: Deepoâs chatroom utilizes a Jim Henson Digital Puppetry rig to allow guests to have a real-time conversation with an animated character. I am a member of the small team of actors and writers who are workshopping and developing a script that is both approachable and on point with the Aquariumâs message.
    Cabaret Rising    Time: 2018.2 ~ 2018.3    Description: Cabaret Rising was an epic immersive theatre production located in the Dupont Underground in Washington DC. I was the lead puzzle designer, creating interactive narrative &#39;quests&#39; that particularly engaged audience members could participate in. I was also a performer and the lead house manager.
    Scientist Birthday Party at Georgia Aquarium    Time: 2012.12 ~ 2013.1    Description: Due to requests from customers, our department created a whole new Birthday Party layout. Previous parties had included a short craft, a very basic tour, and the celebration. The Scientist Birthday party replaced the craft with an experiment and lengthened the tour. I was personally responsible for coming up with the experiment, and had to write multiple performance-ready scripts, in case our content management team couldn&#39;t work with one of the ideas. All scripts are now being developed further for use in the Georgia Aquariumâs sleepover programs.
    Fine Arts Weekend    Time: 2013.1 ~ 2014.4    Description: Project still in very beginning stages.
