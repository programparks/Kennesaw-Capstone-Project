Summary: As an Instructional &amp; Information Designer, my greatest successes are in the areas of design, development, and evaluation of training programs and materials. I excel in establishing partnerships with business units, project managers, and subject matter experts to conduct need analysis and training solutions.&#92;n&#92;nWhen I was 12 my grandfather told me to never stop learning. This instilled a passion for learning that has guided my life and work. It is my intention to infuse, on an emotional level, this passion in the training that I develop. I have a commitment to the learner to create training that is learner-centered, passionate, and enlightening, and to connect with an audience in an effort to help them become more effective in their professional and personal lives.&#92;n &#92;nTo achieve my high level of standards and commitment requires skills beyond technology.  Skills such as being a good listener, creativity, detail oriented, coaching, communication, and a passion for impacting the lives of others. By combining these soft skills with the hard skills of technology, I develop innovative instructional strategies and blended learning solutions.&#92;n&#92;nThe implementation of these strategies requires knowledge of technologies that allow for blended learning. I have extensive experience in project management, Microsoft Office Suites, graphic design, Articulate 360, Captivate, and Adobe Creative Cloud. This is combined with experience in instructional design and development, blended learning, training, and curriculum material development, multimedia, video creation and editing.&#92;n&#92;nCreating a learning environment that encourages and supports lifelong learning is a talent not everyone possesses. Using training to empower learners to embrace the material and build on the foundation of that information, to become, not only a better employee but also a better person, is my gift.
