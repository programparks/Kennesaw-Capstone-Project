Projects:
    Utilizing SAS to Estimate Rates of Disease for Nationally Representative Databases    Time: 2013.12 ~ 2014.2    Description: We describe burden of disease by analyzing the statistical association of various diseases with: hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, ambulatory/outpatient (doctorsâ office) visits, and deaths. In this short paper, we use large, nationally representative databases, such as those offered by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) or the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), to produce reliable estimates of disease for studies. In this example, we use SASÂ® and SASÂ®-callable SUDAANÂ® to analyze the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), offered by AHRQ, to estimate all-cause gastro related hospitalizations in children less than 3 years old.
    Comparison of Decision Tree Model and Logistic Regression for Prediction of Commercial Credit Risk    Time: 2017.1 ~ Now    Description: Utilizing sub prime commercial customer files to predict credit risk
    Monthly Bike Commuter Breakfasts    Time: 2012.5 ~ Now    Description: I organize the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition&#39;s monthly Bike Commuter Breakfasts. When I started organizing them, they had an attendance of 5 cyclists, and now they have an average attendance of 25.
    National Estimate of Acute Flaccid Myelitis Hospitalizations among Children, Ages 1-20    Time: 2015 ~ Now    Description: Utilization case reports of acute flaccid myelitis (unknown etiology) to define condition and applying definition to national dataset of pediatric hospitalizations to produce estimates of disease for surveillance. 
    National Estimate of Hospitalizations and Emergency Department Visits for Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease    Time: 2011.12 ~ Now    Description: Academic paper describing the hospitalization and emergency department visit burden of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease in children less than 5 years of age.
    Application of Support Vector Machine Modeling for Disease Classification    Time: 2017.1 ~ Now    Description: Study comparing predictive power of SVM with traditional logistic regression for high dimensional health data.
