Summary: Thank you, I appreciate you visiting my LinkedIn Profile.  Helping companies be more effective, efficient, and sustain growth is my focus.  When change is needed, typically you canât afford to be wrong.  With a focus on validation through a twostep process, a winning strategy is created much earlier than before.  &#92;nThe types of problems I specialize in solving:&#92;n     - Difficulty hitting operation or sales targets?&#92;n     - Ready to sell your business, but need a better valuation through increased profitability?&#92;n     - Growing two years ago, but canât seem to hit double digit growth?&#92;n     - Doing well financially, but high turnover?&#92;nI have a holistic enterprise view of organization because of my professional background and education. This has equipped me to tackle and solve a variety of issues in areas of operations, marketing, sales, customer service, and finance.    &#92;nI specialize in using interviews and meetings to uncover critical areas while creating sense of ownership through employee involvement.  This allows me to gather information while leveraging data already in the organization to validate a strategy before it is implemented.  This is what makes my process unique and highly accurate: involvement from employees, collecting, interpreting and leveraging data to validate information found through interviews and meetings to create a winning strategy faster.   &#92;nPeople that Iâve worked with would describe me as âhigh energyâ, âdynamicâ, âbrilliant with analyticsâ, and an âinnovative thinkerâ. Please feel free to review my recommendations.  The process I use is successful, itâs teachable (you wonât need me for an extended period), and we can accelerate through organizational change quickly and efficiently. &#92;n&#92;nFor more information, please visit: https://dmaxey.com&#92;n&#92;nManagement Consulting â¦ Strategy Consulting â¦ Operational Excellence â¦ SaaS â¦ Complex Sales Cycles â¦ B2B â¦ Budget &amp; Cost Control â¦ Process Optimization â¦ Key Metrics (KPI) â¦ Forecasting  â¦ Data Analysis
