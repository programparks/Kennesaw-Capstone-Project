The information will be stored in the school&#39;s database. I was tasked with building the logic using Python and working on the SQL.
    Chappy    Time: 2015.8 ~ 2015.12    Description: The purpose of this project was to create a service that would allow campus students who felt unsafe to use an app to request a chaperone. This chaperone would walk with them to their destination.
