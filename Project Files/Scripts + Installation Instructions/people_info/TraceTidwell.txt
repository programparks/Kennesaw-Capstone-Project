Projects:
    Geckoboard Challenge    Time: 2016.10 ~ 2016.10    Description: Wrote a Python script that pulls data from the Twitter REST API and sends it to the Geckoboard API as part of an job application challenge. The number of Twitter followers and the number of Twitter mentions each day are sent to Geckoboard, where they are displayed on a dashboard.
    Predicting High (&gt;$50k) or Low (&lt;âPk) Income from US Census Data    Time: 2016.10 ~ 2016.10    Description: Research Project for CPSC605 - Data Mining &amp; Data Analysis. Will compare 5 classifiers on 3 different US Census datasets to determine which classifier best predicts high or low income.
    Implementation of K-Means Algorithm    Time: 2016.11 ~ 2016.11    Description: Instructions: In this assignment you will implement the KMeans algorithm, you can use R or Python to write your source code. Name your source code file as KMeans.R or KMeans.py. Run your source code on the Iris dataset, you can find the dataset in the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris), read the dataset description to discover how many clusters (K) you should ask for when you run your implementation.&#92;n&#92;nFor initialization, use any random function to set the initial clustersâ centers, k points. For stopping criteria use the following two criteria: 1) The squared Euclidean distances between the old mean and the current mean â¬ is less than a threshold, say 0.001. 2) The number of iterations is less than 20.&#92;n&#92;nSubmission: You should submit two files: 1) Your KMeans source code file, name it as: KMeans.R or KMeans.py 2) A report file which includes: the size of each cluster, the number of iterations, the final â¬, the cluster label for each data point, and the accuracy of your algorithm.
